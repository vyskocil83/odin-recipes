        <h4>Enchiladas in a pan with a fork.</h4>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 Savoy cabbage leaves</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can spicy refried beans</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups shredded cheese such as Monterey Jack, Cheddar or Colby-Jack, divided</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can red enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add cabbage leaves and cook for 1 minute.  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Pat dry.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Combine chicken, refriend beans and 3/4 cup cheese in a medium bowl.  Coat the bottom of a 9-by-13 inch baking dish with a few tablespoons enchilada sauce.  Fill each cabbage leaf with about 1/3 cup of the chicken mixture and roll into an enchilada.  Place, seam-side down, in the baking dish (they will be snug).  Drizzle with remaining enchilada sauce and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake until heated through and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with cilantro, if desired.</li>
        </ol>

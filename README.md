# odin-recipes

This is the very first assignment I've completed and uploaded with the Odin Project.

I used the following tools:

- Oracle Virtual Machine
- Visual Code Editor
- Terminal Emulator
- W3 Markup Validation Service

I also used the following skills:

- knowledge of HTML language including filling out the boilerplate, adding headings, images. links, ordered and unordered lists
- created directories and files
- problem-solved when a collaborator was added to my repository upon commit (I realized I didn't configure my github properly)
- linked files to each other
